# MiniProject-Minesweeper
DSA MINIPROJECT
Features :
   This game will have four difficulty levels. One of them will be custom, in which user will select the number of rows, columns and mines.
   User has to click once for flagging/unflagging a box. And has to double click to open the box.
   If you change the width of the terminal, the game will adjust itself to the center.
   One new feature I have added is "resume". If somehow your terminal or even laptop stops working, you can resume the previous game just by one click.
