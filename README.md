Features :<br/>
   This game will have four difficulty levels. One of them will be custom, in which user will select the number of rows, columns and mines.<br/>
   Easy level will have 10 rows, 10 columns and 15 mines.<br/>
   Medium level will have 12 rows, 15 columns and 30 mines.<br/>
   Hard level will have 12 rows, 20 columns and 50 mines.<br/>
   
   User has to <b>click once<b/> for flagging/unflagging a box. And has to <b>double click<b/> to open the box.<br/>
   If you change the width of the terminal, the game will adjust itself to the center.<br/>
   One new feature I have added is "resume". If somehow your terminal or even laptop shuts down, you can resume the previous game just by one click. The game will create a file 'resumedata.txt' while running, if you delete this file, you will not be able to resume the game as the saved data will be deleted.<br/>
